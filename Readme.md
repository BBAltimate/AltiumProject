Project Description
The Low pass Filter is designed for the 30 W audio input.
Whole idea of creating this circuit was to attenuate the noise from the audio signal and produce a better output circuit. 
The circuit is designed with minimal and easily available components which can be ordered from: https://www.digikey.ca/
You can find the components list in the wiki section of the project.
Moving further: The board was in-house manufactured using milling machine. 
Link to the website of mill machine is provided in case you want to have a look at the machine.
For all project related documents one can refer the wiki section of the project.
Once the designing is done. Gerber files are generated. How to generate the gerb files in Altium Designer: https://www.altium.com/documentation/altium-designer/workspacemanager-dlg-gerbersetup-formgerber-setup-ad
One can manufacture the board anywhere in the world with PCB board manufacturing capability. I used Milling Machine to manufacture my board.
